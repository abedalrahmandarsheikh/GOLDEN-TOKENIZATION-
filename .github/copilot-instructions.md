# Copilot Instructions for GOLDEN-TOKENIZATION

## Overview
"GOLDEN TOKENIZATION" is a blockchain-based platform for tokenizing assets and companies, integrating AI and metaverse technologies to enable smart, transparent, and secure digital investment. The project is in its early stages, with the architecture and codebase still under development.

## Key Principles
- **Blockchain Focus:** All core logic should be designed with blockchain integration in mind. Smart contracts, asset tokenization, and secure transaction flows are central.
- **AI & Metaverse Integration:** The platform aims to leverage AI for investment intelligence and metaverse for immersive experiences. Design with extensibility for these domains.
- **Arabic Localization:** User-facing content and documentation should support Arabic as a primary language.

## Project Structure
- The current codebase is minimal. The main documentation is in `README.md`.
- Expect future directories for smart contracts, backend services, frontend UI, and AI modules.

## Development Conventions
- **Documentation:** All new modules must include clear, bilingual (Arabic/English) documentation.
- **Security:** Prioritize security best practices, especially for blockchain and user data.
- **Extensibility:** Write modular, extensible code to accommodate rapid feature growth.

## Example Patterns
- Use clear, descriptive names for contracts, services, and modules (e.g., `AssetToken`, `InvestmentAI`).
- Document data flows for tokenization and investment logic as they are implemented.

## Getting Started
- Review `README.md` for the project vision and goals.
- When adding new components, create stubs with docstrings and TODOs outlining intended functionality.

## Future Integration Points
- Smart contract deployment and interaction (likely via Solidity/Ethereum or similar)
- AI model integration for investment analytics
- Metaverse platform APIs for immersive asset visualization
